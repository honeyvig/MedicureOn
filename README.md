----------------------
To support the development of MediCureOn, a decentralized AI-powered healthcare platform using blockchain, cloud technologies, and IoT integrations, you would need a comprehensive set of Python-based code snippets and system architecture to get started. The project involves various technologies like blockchain, Azure Cloud, IoT, smart contracts, and healthcare data standards (FHIR, HL7).

Here's a Python-based code structure and related components to help you begin building the system. It outlines key roles, technology stacks, and provides a starting point for integrating AI, blockchain, and IoT services within the MediCureOn platform.
High-Level System Architecture

    AI-Powered Health Services:
        An AI model that offers personalized recommendations, diagnoses, and predictions based on patient data.

    Blockchain for Data Security & Decentralization:
        Smart contracts to ensure data privacy and secure transactions.

    IoT Integration for Real-time Health Data:
        Collect health data from IoT devices (wearables, sensors) and store it on the cloud.

    Cloud Infrastructure:
        Use Azure to store health records, ensure scalability, and manage services (FHIR API, CosmosDB, Azure Functions).

Core Python-based Components
1. Smart Contract Deployment Using Python & Web3 (Blockchain)

Using Solidity to write smart contracts for the platform (to handle patient records, healthcare transactions, etc.) and Python (web3.py) to deploy and interact with Ethereum-based blockchain:

from web3 import Web3
from solcx import compile_standard, install_solc

# Install Solidity compiler if not installed
install_solc('0.8.0')

# Connect to Ethereum network (using a testnet like Rinkeby)
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY'))

# Smart contract in Solidity
contract_source_code = '''
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HealthRecord {
    struct Patient {
        uint256 id;
        string name;
        string condition;
        address owner;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Patient) public patients;

    function addPatient(uint256 _id, string memory _name, string memory _condition) public {
        patients[_id] = Patient(_id, _name, _condition, msg.sender);
    }

    function getPatient(uint256 _id) public view returns (string memory, string memory) {
        Patient memory patient = patients[_id];
        return (patient.name, patient.condition);
    }
}
'''

# Compile the Solidity contract
compiled_sol = compile_standard({
    "language": "Solidity",
    "sources": {"HealthRecord.sol": {"content": contract_source_code}},
    "settings": {"outputSelection": {"*": {"*": ["metadata", "evm.bytecode"]}}}
})

# Extract ABI and bytecode from compiled contract
abi = compiled_sol['contracts']['HealthRecord.sol']['HealthRecord']['metadata']
bytecode = compiled_sol['contracts']['HealthRecord.sol']['HealthRecord']['evm']['bytecode']['object']

# Deploying the contract
HealthRecord = w3.eth.contract(abi=abi, bytecode=bytecode)
account = w3.eth.accounts[0]  # Replace with actual wallet address
nonce = w3.eth.getTransactionCount(account)

# Send transaction to deploy the contract
transaction = HealthRecord.constructor().buildTransaction({
    'from': account,
    'gas': 4000000,
    'gasPrice': w3.toWei('20', 'gwei'),
    'nonce': nonce,
})

signed_txn = w3.eth.account.sign_transaction(transaction, private_key='YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY')
txn_hash = w3.eth.sendRawTransaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)

print(f'Contract deployed! Txn hash: {txn_hash.hex()}')

This script deploys a basic smart contract for storing and retrieving patient health records. You would adapt it to interact with the MediCureOn platform for data management, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations (HIPAA, GDPR).
2. AI-based Health Recommendations (Machine Learning)

For AI-driven recommendations, we can use scikit-learn for machine learning and create models based on historical health data to offer insights for patients.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import pandas as pd

# Sample health dataset (to be replaced with real health data)
data = {
    'age': [25, 35, 45, 55, 65],
    'blood_pressure': [120, 130, 140, 150, 160],
    'heart_rate': [80, 85, 90, 95, 100],
    'condition': ['Healthy', 'At risk', 'At risk', 'Unhealthy', 'Unhealthy']
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert 'condition' to numeric
df['condition'] = df['condition'].map({'Healthy': 0, 'At risk': 1, 'Unhealthy': 2})

# Feature columns and target
X = df[['age', 'blood_pressure', 'heart_rate']]
y = df['condition']

# Split data into train/test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

In a real-world scenario, this AI model could be used to provide health predictions, monitor trends, and generate personalized recommendations for patients based on their health data.
3. IoT Integration for Real-Time Health Data (Azure IoT)

You can integrate IoT devices (e.g., wearables, sensors) using Azure IoT Hub to collect real-time health data. The data can be sent to the MediCureOn platform for analysis and decision-making.

import time
import random
from azure.iot.device import IoTHubDeviceClient, Message

# Setup IoT Hub connection (replace with actual IoT Hub credentials)
CONNECTION_STRING = "Your IoT Device Connection String"
client = IoTHubDeviceClient.create_from_connection_string(CONNECTION_STRING)

# Function to simulate real-time health data from a wearable device
def send_health_data():
    heart_rate = random.randint(60, 120)
    temperature = random.uniform(36.5, 38.5)
    blood_pressure = random.randint(110, 140)
    
    message = {
        'heart_rate': heart_rate,
        'temperature': temperature,
        'blood_pressure': blood_pressure,
        'timestamp': time.time()
    }
    
    # Create a message to send to IoT Hub
    msg = Message(str(message))
    
    # Send the message to IoT Hub
    client.send_message(msg)
    print(f'Sent message: {message}')

# Simulate sending data every 10 seconds
while True:
    send_health_data()
    time.sleep(10)

This example sends simulated health data to Azure IoT Hub. You can adjust it to interact with actual IoT sensors and handle real-time data ingestion.
4. Azure Cloud Setup for Healthcare API (FHIR)

Using Azure’s FHIR API for healthcare data, you can manage and store patient information in a secure, standardized format.

import requests

# FHIR API endpoint (replace with actual endpoint)
FHIR_ENDPOINT = "https://your-fhir-api.azurehealthcareapis.com/fhir/Patient"

# Sample patient data
patient_data = {
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "id": "12345",
    "name": [{"use": "official", "family": "Doe", "given": ["John"]}],
    "gender": "male",
    "birthDate": "1990-05-10",
}

# Send a POST request to create a patient record in FHIR API
response = requests.post(FHIR_ENDPOINT, json=patient_data, headers={
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/fhir+json'
})

if response.status_code == 201:
    print("Patient record created successfully!")
else:
    print(f"Error creating patient record: {response.status_code}")

This code sends patient data to the Azure FHIR API. The FHIR standard is commonly used in healthcare for data interoperability, ensuring secure and accurate patient data management.
Conclusion:

This Python-based structure provides foundational code to kick-start the MediCureOn platform, focusing on:

    Blockchain for secure, decentralized data management.
    AI for predictive healthcare services.
    IoT Integration for real-time health data collection.
    Cloud Infrastructure using Azure for scalability and FHIR-compliant data storage.

As you continue developing, each component can be expanded with more complex models, further blockchain integration, and enhanced cloud functionality, ultimately creating a robust, patient-centric healthcare platform.
